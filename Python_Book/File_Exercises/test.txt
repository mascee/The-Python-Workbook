Exercise 171. Consistent Line Lengths.
While 80 characters is a common width for a terminal window,
some terminals are narrow or wider.
This can present challenges 
when displaying documents containing paragraphs of text.
The lines might be too long and wrap,
 making them difficult to read, or they might be too short
and fail to make good use of the available space.
Write a program that opens a file and displays it so that each line is as full as possible.
If you read a line
 that is too long, then the program should break it up into words and add them to the current
line until it is full. Then the program should start a new line and display the remaining words. If the line is too short, then 
use words from the next line of the file to finish filling the current output.
Ensure that the program works correctly for files containing multiple paragraphs of text.
You can detect the end of one paragraph and the begining of the next by looking for lines that are 
empty ones the end of the line marker has been removed.
Hint: Use a constant to represent the maximum line length.
